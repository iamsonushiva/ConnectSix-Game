        "The Connect SIX Game Rules are easy to understand. In fact, it is in the name. To win Connect six, all you have to do is to choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a ten-column, nine-row vertically suspended grid.
                The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column.The objective of this game is to connect six of your colored checker pieces in a row, much the same as tic tac toe. This can be done horizontally, vertically only. 
                Each player will drop in one checker piece at a time. This will give you a chance to either build your row, or stop your opponent from getting six in a row.              The game is over either when you or your friend reaches six in a row,or when all  slots are filled, ending in a stalemate.
               If you and your friend decide to play again, the first player typically goes first.
              The rules of the game are easy to learn, but difficult to master.
             That is the beauty of Connect SIX . Now that you know the Connect SIX board game rules, now is the time to challenge everyone you know.
              No matter their age or skill level, they can play this game with you.
                 Now that you understand the rules, share Connect SIX with everyone around you.
